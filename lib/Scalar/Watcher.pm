=head1 NAME

Scalar::Watcher - watch a scalar variable when value changed or freed

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Scalar::Watcher qw(when_modified);

  {
    my $a = 123;
    $a = 456;
    when_modified $a, sub { print "catch $_[0]\n" };
    when_freed $a, sub { print "freed $_[0]\n" };
    $a = 'oo';
    $a = 567;

    # then you'll get
    # catch oo
    # catch 567
    # freed 567
  }

  {
    # or with a canceller
    my $a = 123;
    my $canceller = when_modified $a, sub { print "catch $_[0]\n" };
    $a = 456;
    undef $canceller;
    $a = 789;

    # then you'll get
    # catch 456
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Stub documentation for Scalar::Watcher, created by h2xs. It looks like the

unedited.

Blah blah blah.
